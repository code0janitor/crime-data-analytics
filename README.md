**To provide a platform for data aggregation for both exploratory and statistical analytics on crime data. The main idea to build this project to:**
1. Build a data ingestion layer for crime incedents
2. Build grapph model for:
   - 2.1 exploratory analysis
   - 2.2 crime profile modeling using a model close POLE modeling
3. Build analytics and dashboard
4. Build police coverage needs [to beat, sector & district] prediction on hostorical data
5. Build crime based [date & time based] routing  on hostorical data
